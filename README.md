This is the config I use for Klipper on my Voron2.4r2 3D Printer.
- Raspberry PI 3b - Mainsail OS
- BIGTREETECH Octopus MAX EZ V1.0
- BTT EBB SB2209 CAN

This is a repository for automated backups to my klipper configuration.
It is public because it provides some real world examples for some features you might want to implement.
It is thus public only for educational purposes.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRY TO COPY PASTE PARTS OF THIS CONFIGURATION INTO YOUR OWN.
YOUR PRINTER WILL HAVE DIFFERENT HARDWARE, FIRMWARE, PIN NAMES, OS...

Disclaimer:
- The developer is not responsible for any therapy costs induced by trying to understand, modify, or otherwise interact with the dark magic known as "Klipper configuration."
- The developer of this project denies any responsibility for the collapse of space-time that may occur if you use this config to print black holes. Also, use caution when experimenting with 3D printed portals to alternate dimensions.
- Should these configurations lead to the creation of a technological singularity, resulting in the rise of sentient printers, the creator assumes no liability.
