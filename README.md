This is the config I use for Klipper on my Voron2.4r2 3D Printer.
- Raspberry PI 3b - Mainsail OS
- BIGTREETECH Octopus MAX EZ V1.0
- BTT EBB SB2209 CAN

This repository stores a backup and history of my Klipper configuration.
A service on my Raspberry Pi automatically pushes any changes to this repository.
I left it public because it provides functional real world examples for the features I use.
It is thus public only for educational purposes.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRY TO COPY PASTE PARTS OF THIS CONFIGURATION INTO YOUR OWN.
YOUR PRINTER WILL HAVE DIFFERENT HARDWARE, FIRMWARE, PIN NAMES, OPERATING SYSTEM...

- The developer of this project denies any responsibility for the collapse of space-time that may occur if you use this config to print black holes. Also, use caution when experimenting with 3D printed portals to alternate dimensions.
- Should these configurations lead to the creation of a technological singularity, resulting in the rise of sentient printers, the creator assumes no liability.
